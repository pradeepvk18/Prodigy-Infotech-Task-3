<br>
<img src="DS Task3.png">

Welcome to my submission for **Task 3** of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`.

In this task, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this task is:

🔗 [Task 3 - Bank Marketing Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%203)

The dataset contains customer information such as:

- Age
- Job
- Marital Status
- Education
- Balance
- Housing Loan
- Personal Loan
- Contact Type
- Campaign Details
- Previous Marketing Outcome

**Target Variable:**  
`y` → Whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (Yes/No)

## 🔎 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

- Loaded the dataset
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets

### 2️⃣ Model Building

- Implemented **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Trained the model using training data
- Tuned hyperparameters (if required)

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Decision Tree Visualization
